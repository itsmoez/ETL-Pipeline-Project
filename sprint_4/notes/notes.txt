Need to find a way to automate adding dotenv file to AWS's Lamnda environmental variables. 
Unable to connect to database via AWS Lambda - needs more research leave for the future. 
Everything else works, if you need to run certain modules you need to sepcify them in the requirements text file. 

Succesfully ran the ETL Stack and Deployment bucket. 
Unable to connect to the database from AWS as it is a local host would most likely need to to use an EC2 instance which is part 
of the next step anyway. The only difference being that we will begin loading to our redshit database.
