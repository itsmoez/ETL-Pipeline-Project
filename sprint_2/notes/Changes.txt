Changes Table structure to replace drink type and flavour with simply product name which includes the flavour. -Easier to create queries this way. 
    - Changed transform code to produce just product name and price. 
    - Since we cannot have any null values it make sense to do this. 

Added items id to transaction ID so we have a unique id for each item from the order, if the same product appears twice we can generate 
different ids for them. Also moves away from composite keys and keeps relation ships through via foreign keys.  
    -Changed the transform code to reflect this as well 

Changed the GUIDs function to create hashed GUIDs based on our columns values for each row this means we will get a
unique ID for transactions, transaction items. But also if the column values are the same such branch name it will produce the same ID
which will not be added to the tables therefore avoiding duplication the same goes for our products table. 
    - Tested. 

Created a function that runs our SQL script and creates the tables prior to inserting our transformed data.
